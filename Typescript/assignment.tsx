else if(totalScore>0)
console.log("you are an introvert\n Introverts are tricky to understand, since itâ€™s so easy for us to assume that introversion is the same as being shy, when, in fact, introverts are simply people who find it tiring to be around other people")

else
 console.log("you are an ambivert!\n Since introverts and extroverts are the extremes of the scale, the rest of us fall somewhere in the middle. Many of us lean one way or the other, but there are some who are quite balanced between the two tendencies. These people are called ambiverts")
